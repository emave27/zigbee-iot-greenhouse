# ZigBee IoT greenhouse project

ZigBee-based IoT project to remotely manage and control a greenhouse.

The aim of this project is to build an IoT system based on ZigBee protocol to control and manage a greenhouse. The system is based on Digi XBee 3 modules, that are used to handle ZigBee protocol and connections.

A Rasperry PI board is used to gather all the data and manage the system. All scripts are written in Python.
